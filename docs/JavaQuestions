* Should the object (e.g. User) implement save() or should the DB adapter have a
        `save(User)` method and have user's save be `DbAdapter.save(this)`?

* REST: Do I return JSON messages back on errors or HTTP status codes?
    * How to differentiate between different error conditions:
        * DB connection issues
        * attempted insertion of a duplicate username
        * invalid email address (FE could pre-validate using endpoint)
